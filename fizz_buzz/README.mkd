# Fizz Buzz

Given an integer n, output the string representation of number 1 through n. For multiples of three, instead, output *Fizz*, likewise for multiples of five, output *Buzz*, and for both output *FizzBuzz*.

**Example:**
```
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
```

### How to compile
```bash
make run
```

### How to run test
```bash
make test
```

### How to debug the program
```bash
gcc -g name_of_file.c -o name_of_file
gdb name_of_file
```

#### How to start the Program
* break main
* run - Execute the program
* next - Next Line
* print &i - Print the address of the variable
* print sizeof(int) - Print sizeof the int type
* x/4xb &i - Get the raw bytes of i. I want to examinate 4 values formatted as hex numerals. byte by byte
* ptype i - Tell me the type of c expression
* x/12xb &a - a is an array

### Linking stuff and generating the program

If you have modules you have to compile one by one
```bash
gcc -c module1.c # This command generates module1.o
gcc -c program-that-depends-of-module1.c
gcc -o program.out module1.o program-that-depends-of-module1.o
./program.out
```
